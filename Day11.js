// Activity 1: Understanding Promises
// Task 1: Create a promise that resolves with a message after a 2-second timeout and log the message to the console.


// Task 2: Create a promise that rejects with an error message after a 2-second timeout and handle the error using .catch().


// Activity 2: Chaining Promises
// Task 3: Create a sequence of promises that simulate fetching data from a server. Chain the promises to log messages in a specific order.


// Activity 3: Using Async/Await
// Task 4: Write an async function that waits for a promise to resolve and then logs the resolved value.


// Task 5: Write an async function that waits for a promise to resolve and then logs the resolved value.


// Activity 4: Fetching Data from an API
// Task 6: Use the fetch API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using promises.


// Task 7: Use the fetch API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using async/await.


// Activity 5: Concurrent Promises
// Task 8: Use Promise.all() to wait for multiple promises to resolve and then log all their values.


// Task 9: Use Promise.race() to log the value of the first promise that resolves among multiple promises.
